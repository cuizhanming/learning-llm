      "The approach introduced in the LongLoRA paper focuses on enhancing the context length of large language models by incorporating shifted sparse attention (S2-Attn) during training to approximate standard self-attention patterns. This method enables extending the context window of models like Llama2 7B and 13B to significantly larger lengths, such as 100k and 32k respectively, on a single 8× A100 machine. The approach maintains the original attention architecture during inference, ensuring compatibility with existing optimization and infrastructure. Furthermore, the paper introduces a supervised fine-tuning solution using the LongAlpaca dataset to enhance chat ability in large language models. Additionally, the LongLoRA paper introduces the Action Units Relation Transformer (ART) and the Tampered AU Prediction (TAP) to improve forgery detection by capturing intra-face relations and generating challenging pseudosamples for model learning. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset evaluations and emphasizes the significance of modeling relations between different facial action units to enhance generalization.\n",

This method aims to provide a beneficial initialization for subsequent LoRA fine-tuning, addressing performance gaps observed in downstream tasks when quantization and fine-tuning are combined. LoftQ has been demonstrated to outperform existing quantization methods, particularly in challenging low-bit scenarios, across various tasks in natural language processing. By utilizing low-rank adapters, LoftQ effectively reduces memory requirements during training and storage, showcasing its potential for model compression and task adaptation in large language models. The method also involves setting specific hyperparameters for different tasks and datasets, and it has shown superior performance in reducing memory usage compared to pruning methods. Additionally, the paper extends the application of low-rank adapters to convolutional layers, highlighting the versatility of LoftQ in various scenarios for efficient model compression.\n",
